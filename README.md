# Project Notes

> The project took me longer than I expected. It was first done using text and different letters indicated different pieces. After I learned about the canvas element and was able to use graphics instead, I chose to pursue that goal instead. As I finished one thing, I chose to try to do more continually. Eventually I had all the mechanics and a minimap added. But that was when I was told that the game had no real objective. So I decided to put in the colored squares and create gameplay out of that. This also spiraled out of control and took me way longer than it should.

# Project Summary

> This project is a website for a small game I've created. The game is 2D game where the player can walk around in a randomly generated world and explore to find and collect other colored squares. If the player finds 5 of the squares it's considered a win. The game uses a shadowcasting that makes exploring the world a bit more interesting. The front page describes the systems a bit more in the depth and there's also a contact page where you can contact me for more information.

# User Guide

> For the website, there are links in the top left of the website so you can navigate it as you please. On the contact page you can use the contact form by writing your email in the adress box and then your message in the text field. Press the send button and your email will be sent. In the game page, you use the 4 buttons to the bottom to move your character around. Press the restart button to restart the level. In the top right there's a minimap detailing where you are in the map and underneath some useful information. To the left are information about the colored squares.
