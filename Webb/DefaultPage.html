                        <h2>The game</h2>
                        <p>This is a simple game where you can navigate a 2D-grid enviroment
                            with obstacles to try and catch different colored squares that
                            try to run away from you. <br> <br>
                            It features a UI which gives you handy information as well.
                            It tells you where you are in the world, both through a minimap, but also gives your coordinates.
                            You can tell how many squares there are in the game and which direction they are in, as well as if they're close or not.
                            If you catch them they will then be added under your location information. 
                            There are 4 buttons for moving around in the world and another one for restarting.
                            <br><br>
                            When you catch 5 of them you win!

                        <h2>Randomly generated enviroments</h2>
                        <p>
                            The enviroments are randomly generated using cellular automata.
                            This means that it randomly adds obstacles all over the given game-area.
                            It then checks each square in the grid if it is solid and then checks to see if its neighbours are solid.
                            If too few neighbours are solid it becomes an empty square. <br> <br>
                            This is a fairly simple way to create a randomly generated enviroment that isn't too random.

                        <h2>Shadowcasting</h2>
                        <p>The game features a way to calculate field of view called "Symmetric Shadowcasting". 
                            The implementation is based on Albert Fords version from <a href="https://www.albertford.com/shadowcasting/">--his website.--</a></p>
